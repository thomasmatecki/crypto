## A handful of cryptographic primitives, schemes, and mechanisms.

Includes:
* An end-to-end encryption scheme.
* An authenticated encryption scheme
* A length preserving encryption scheme and a format preserving credit card encryption scheme. 
* An toy cipher similar to the German Enigma machine.
* An implementation of the SHA256 hash algorithm
* Soup-to-nuts implementations of a PRG, PRF and Encryption Scheme based on the hardness discrete log and factoring.
